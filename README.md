# NomadScanner - Stealth Portscanner for Red Teams

**NomadScanner** is a stealthy, memory-only Windows port scanner designed for red team operations, evasion testing, and internal assessments. It uses randomized HTTP probes, domain fronting, in-memory result handling, and optional payloads for scanning without dropping files or generating noisy output.

---

## Features

- Memory-only output (no stdout or file writes)
- Multithreaded scanning with jittered delays
- IPv4 & IPv6 support via getaddrinfo
- Randomized HTTP probes (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- Domain fronting (custom Host headers)
- Custom payload support (HTTP template style)
- Banner grabbing for fingerprinting
- Port exclusion and range support
- Hostname spoofing
- MAC spoof stub (for later extension)
- XOR-based string obfuscation function
- No console window — results shown via `MessageBoxA`

---

## Usage

```bash
NomadScanner.exe <target_ip> <ports> [payload.txt] [exclude_ports] [fronting_host]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Basic scan
NomadScanner.exe 127.0.0.1 80,443

# Scan port range with exclusions
NomadScanner.exe 10.0.0.1 1-1024 payload.txt 135,445

# Domain fronting example
NomadScanner.exe 10.0.0.5 80-90 payload.txt 135,445 www.microsoft.com
```

---

## Payload Template (Optional)

If using a `payload.txt` file, use placeholders:

```http
GET /status HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: %s\r\nUser-Agent: %s\r\n\r\n
```

Where:
- `%s` → replaced with fronting domain or IP
- `%s` → replaced with randomized `User-Agent`

## Build Instructions

### Visual Studio (Recommended)

- Open `NomadScanner.sln`
- Set configuration to `Release x64`
- Build → Output: `x64\Release\NomadScanner.exe`

### MinGW (alternative)

```bash
gcc -mwindows -s -O3 -o NomadScanner.exe main.c -lws2_32 -liphlpapi
```
